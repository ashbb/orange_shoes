Just a trial to traslate Shoes like app written in Ruby into HTML5 Canvas element written in JavaScript.

Fantastic logo icons were created by [Zachary Scott](https://github.com/zacharyscott). I love them!


Usage
-----

- Run your Orange Shoes app written in Ruby, i.e. `ruby sample.rb`
- Orange Shoes will output the html file: `orange_shoes_output.html`
- You can open the html file with your browser, i.e. FireFox


Samples
--------

- [sample01](http://www.rin-shun.com/shoes/orange-shoes-sample1.html) : Two ovals
- [sample02](http://www.rin-shun.com/shoes/orange-shoes-sample2.html) : Moving two ovals
- [sample03](http://www.rin-shun.com/shoes/orange-shoes-sample3.html) : Pong Game

Note
----

Want to find the way to execute Ruby code in HTML file for creating decent Orange Shoes apps...

I've not found the way yet, so tried another approach. 
Just added `js` method. You can write javascript code as a text data in Ruby. 
Look at [sample03](http://www.rin-shun.com/shoes/orange-shoes-sample3.html). This is a trial so far.
